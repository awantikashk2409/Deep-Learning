SE-II AI Engineer  (Data Science)

Experience: 2–5 years
 

About the Team

The AI Center of Excellence team includes Data Scientists and AI Engineers that work together to conduct research, build prototypes, design features, and build production AI components and systems. Our mission is to leverage the best available technology to protect our customers' attack surfaces.

We partner closely with Detection and Response teams, including our MDR service, to leverage AI/ML for enhanced customer security and threat detection. We operate with a creative, iterative approach, building on 20+ years of threat analysis and a growing patent portfolio. We foster a collaborative environment focused on learning, mentorship, and practical impact.

If you’re early in your data science career and excited to work on real-world AI systems in cybersecurity, this is your opportunity.
 

The technologies we use include:

Python for analysis and modeling using numpy, pandas, and scientific computing libraries

Jupyter notebooks (local & remote)

scikit-learn for machine learning

Anomaly detection for large-scale unlabeled data analysis

LLM/GenAI toolchains: HuggingFace, Transformers, LangChain (foundational exposure)

AWS cloud ecosystem, especially SageMaker, Bedrock, Lambda, S3

Basic exposure to agentic AI concepts and LLM workflows

CI/CD pipelines for ML/LLM workloads (GitHub Actions, Jenkins)

Monitoring and observability tools (CloudWatch, dashboards)


About the Role

Rapid7 is seeking an SE-2 Data Scientist to join our AI Center of Excellence as we expand our AI and MLOps capabilities. This role is focused on building strong data science fundamentals, contributing to ML and LLM workflows, and learning how production AI systems are built and operated at scale.


This role is ideal for someone who is:

building depth in core data science and machine learning,

gaining hands-on experience with AWS-based ML systems, and

developing familiarity with LLMs and agentic AI concepts.

In this role, you will:

Work on data acquisition, cleaning, enrichment, and transformation

Build and evaluate supervised ML models (classification, regression)

Apply unsupervised ML techniques such as clustering and anomaly detection

Contribute to deep learning models (NLP, CNNs, RNNs) under guidance

Assist in developing malware detection and user behavioral models

Contribute to LLM-based workflows, including prompt engineering and basic RAG pipelines

Use existing CI/CD pipelines for training and deployment of ML/LLM models

Support model deployment on AWS SageMaker, Bedrock, and Lambda

Monitor model performance using established dashboards and alerts

Collaborate closely with senior data scientists and engineers to ship features


The skills you’ll bring include:

Core

2–5 years of experience as a Data Scientist or ML Engineer

Strong Python skills with Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn

Solid understanding of:

feature engineering

supervised and unsupervised ML

model evaluation metrics

Exposure to deep learning frameworks (PyTorch / TensorFlow)

Basic familiarity with model explainability (SHAP, LIME)

Working knowledge of AWS ML services (SageMaker, S3, Lambda)

Strong learning mindset and collaborative attitude


Agentic AI & LLM (Foundational Exposure)

Familiarity with LLM concepts and prompt engineering

Exposure to LangChain or similar frameworks

Awareness of RAG pipelines and agent-based workflows


Experience with the following would be advantageous:

Exposure to cybersecurity or malware datasets

Working knowledge of ML/LLM CI/CD pipelines

Basic understanding of monitoring and retraining workflows


We know that the best ideas and solutions come from multi-dimensional teams. That’s because these teams reflect a variety of backgrounds and professional experiences. If you are excited about this role and feel your experience can make an impact, please don’t be shy - apply today.
